/*
First question was a simple number array, sliding window question about ‘alternating parity’(even and odd number stuff). DONE


Second question was about finding similar pairs of words in a string array(pattern searching).
levenstein distance?



Third was a little time-consuming about “cyclical t-shifts” which involved creating a new array from performing actions on two arrays of equal length(dynamic programming? Divide and conquer?).
Last was a matrix question about returning the center coordinates of what the question defines as a “perfect x”.
